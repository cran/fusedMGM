Description: Implementation of fused Markov graphical model (FMGM; Park and Won, 2022). The functions include building mixed graphical model (MGM) objects from data, inference of networks using FMGM, stable edge-specific penalty selection (StEPS) for the determination of penalization parameters, and the visualization. For details, please refer to Park and Won (2022) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2208.14959>.
